0,Gautam Anand,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not durable at all!!!,"  It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.So my ‚Çπ1499 are wasted now..."
1,abhishek,2.0 out of 5 stars,Boat makes the best value Products that only last briefly,"  [BIG UPDATE] IT BROKE ALONG THE RIGHT HINGE, I WAS WEARING IT NORMALLY AND IT SPLIT OPEN ON ONE SIDE.The extenders are weak. ( Pic inscuded) My boat 400s broke at the centre too. They need to concentrate less on celebrity endorsements and use the profits on materials and quality control. They still worked so I taped it up with a metal sheet. Still will give 2 stars for the sound.[ORIGINAL REVIEW]I've owned boat products such as the Rockerz 400 and some of their earphones and this is the best experience I've had with the product.Review after 1 day of use and will updatePrice I paid 1800Pros:1. Packaging is good for the first time2. The build and finish is on par with headphones costing 3 times as much.3. Range is next level, didn't experience any loss of connection in my entire house with the phone kept in one position.4. Boat headphones have always been super uncomfortable but this time they have actually thought of that.5. The cups are big and soft enough to fit your ears inside so they are over the ear.6. Base is not amazing, let's just say it's above average, the sound is like a 20 % improvement on the Rockerz 400.7. They have gone for a organic approach for the sound so the highs and lows are just ok .9. Battery life is just as advertised8. You literally can't find a better pair of headphones for less than 3k  for sure.Cons1. I was not sure about how they actually look when I ordered cos the image of the product kept changing, it had flat cups and then doughnut type cups.2. It's not as loud as I want it to be3. They didn't include a aux Cable which is crazy as they ship those with all other models.4. It does get warm in these and you will sweat5. No noise cancelling as they mentioned and passive design is not that good"
2,Jinnish Dalal,5.0 out of 5 stars,PLUG INTO NIRVANA,"  This is a premium quality product from boAt-Lifestyle. It's professional grade 40 mm drivers truly deliver you to a music nirvana with a professional fine finish. The amazing battery life and the reduced charge time makes it a marathon runner. The ear cushion provides a comfy experience. The sound quality is fabulous and does not give a pain in the ear. It also is easy to carry around as it folds inwards, it also fold towards the sides which makes it extremely easy and safe to keep on a table. All over it is an awesome product."
3,Gizmofreak Reviews,1.0 out of 5 stars,Simply Awful,"  The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save  up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?1 Build"

5,parmar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Poor material..and good service...,  Material is very poor quality but service also very good. Product replace after 10 month even broken. Now condition is new..üëç
6,Danny,1.0 out of 5 stars,Tenuously fragile and worthless,  Never have I seen as fragile headphone as this one. I have been delivered a product with manufacturing defect or it already damaged. The bud from the right side fell off as soon as I unpacked the headphones. Boat rockerz has not been upto my expectation. Think before buying.
7,Murali,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor build quality,"  Poor build quality. One side of the headphone broke down with normal usage within one month of operation. Never expected such a poor quality from boat. To make matters worse, in entire Hyderabad they have only one service centre which is far away at 15 Kms from the city"
8,Vikas Mehta,3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent headphones with some evident drawbacks,"  At 1999 they are decent.Pros1. Light weight because made of plastic2. Battery super cool @ 70 hrs3. I am happy at 40% volume, so they are super loud.4. They have thumping base5. Call quality is good for this price.6 connect easily and the Bluetooth range is excellent. I have tried them keeping my iphone in another room and roaming around the home. No distortion or disconnection.7. They fold so are easy to carryCons:1. Plasticky so can break any time2. Vocals are not clear and are dull. If they had crisp vocals, these would have been the best in the industry.3. They would need time to open up. For my ears they feel stiff and tend to heat after 2-3 hrs of continuous usage. Ears pain after this much usage.4. No case or pouch but was not expecting eaither at this price.Over all a decent product in the price range and can keep it as a spare headphone in my bag if i forget my primary headphones (Marshall Monitor BT) knowing they will always have some charge ( 70 hrs battery at 60% volume)"
9,S.Akshansh,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not durable.,"  I bought this 3 months back and it's broken now as it was all plastic and not much flexible. The product says we have 1-year warranty but physical damage isn'tincluded. Bad experience. I have fixed it with fevi quick as a temporary solution, but I don't know how much time it would work.üò¢"
